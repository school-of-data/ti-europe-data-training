## Training Overview

Based on responses to a pre-training survey, School of Data assessment and Transparency International interests, this five day training focussed on these milestones: data languages, getting and
manipulating data, and presenting insights. This served as an intermediate course that allowed learners to learn concepts, techniques and tools to get the
data they need, manipulate it into a format to gain the insights they need, and share their
insights with their intended audience.

Each milestone comprised of lessons with the following components:

### Discovery/Overview

This is where the facilitator provides an overview of the concept, technique or tool
being introduced. The objective is to provide background details and and overview of
the basic skills needed to become familiar with the objective of the lesson.

### Guided Exercise

This component allows learners to work through the concepts introduced in the
discovery component through an exercise. The facilitator will work through the
exercise together with learners allowing them a chance to complete specific tasks.

### Practice Labs

This component involves learners working on an exercise similar to the guided
exercise but with additional concepts that are based on the foundational concepts
and skill from the previous components The objective is to solidify the ideas under
the lesson.
