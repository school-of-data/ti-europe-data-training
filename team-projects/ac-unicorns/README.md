### Project Question

Is there a positive correlation between gender equality and corruption perceptions in the world?

### Project Description

We want to understand if countries with higher CPI scores have lower gender inequality values.

### Why is this insight valuable?

- Essential for our chaptersâ€™ work (understand if gender equality / female empowerment is an aspect in which we should focus at national levels)
- opening opportunities for building global partnership (gender inequality as a part of Sustainable development goals agenda)
- Academic/research importance

### Who is this insight valuable to?

Firstly for TI, other NGOs that are working on promotion of gender equality or civil society, government and decision makers in each country
