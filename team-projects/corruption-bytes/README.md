### Project Question

Is there a correlation between participation in trade blocs and countries’ CPI score over x number of years?

### Project Description

With our research question, we would like to look at the correlation between participation in trade blocs and countries’ CPI score over x number of years. Our hypothesis: trade bloc agreements result in an improved CPI ranking as they lower trade barriers and (legal) restrictions, which otherwise may provide opportunities for corruption e.g. bribery of customs officials. The lowering of these trade obstructions in turn leads to the perception of less corruption.

### Why is this insight valuable?

The value of this data research would be to see whether free trade and institutionalized trade blocs may improve the anti-corruption tone of a country.

### Who is this insight valuable to?

Depending on the results:
- Pro-open trade politicians
- Anti-open trade politicians
- Supranational / intergovernmental organizations


### Datasets

- Historical overview 2012-2016,
- CPI 2016,
- Pacific Alliance,
- CISFTA

### Project challenges

- Causation: focus on international trade leaves out many other possible reasons for changing perception of corruption (i.e. domestic political developments, economics, influence from other states)
- Data verification
