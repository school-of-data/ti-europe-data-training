### Project Question

Does variation in democratisation affect the perceptions of corruption?

### Project Description

In a context of rising populism worldwide and backsliding of democracy, we want to explore if this affects perception of corruption. We’ll be searching for a correlation between corruption perception and levels of democratisation as defined by the EIU democracy index and the Rule of Law Index. In particular, we will be testing if one index as a stronger relationship to corruption perception than the other and try to answer why.


### Why is this insight valuable?

The common knowledge is that democracy and rule of law involve a lower perception of corruption. We want to test this
hypothesis empirically and verify whether democratisation is a key factor in lower levels of corruption. This insight is valuable for anti-corruption activist who can tailor their advocacy strategies accordingly such as focus on areas such as better justice & electoral systems, protections of fundamental rights etc.. that might conducive to reducing corruption in a country.

### Who is this insight valuable to?

The wider anti-corruption movement, journalists, civil society and citizens concerning about democracy and corruption.

### Datasets

- [CPI2016](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2016) (cpi score, rank, Rule of Law index, Economist Intelligence Unit Index)

### Project challenges

- Figuring out the dimensions to use
- How to program correlations in R and understand the correlation coefficient.
- We don’t want to show the data in a scattered plot graph, so we will look for alternatives
