### Project Question

Is there a positive correlation between happiness and the rule of law?

### Project Description

With this research question we aim to explore how a country's happiness compares to its level of rule of law and how these two concepts might be related. We will be looking into the correlation between a countryâ€™s level of rule of law and the happiness of its citizens by comparing the [Rule of Law Index](https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/wjp-rule-law-index) with the [World Happiness Index](http://worldhappiness.report) in the WE+EU and EE+CA region in between 2014 and 2016.

### Why is this insight valuable?

A similarity between happiness and the rule of law is that the same few countries are performing especially well with regard to both indices. Our hypothesis therefore is that a country with strong rule of law is more likely to be one with happier citizens. If this indeed turns out to be the case then governmental institutions can increase the wellbeing of their citizens by strengthening the rule of law.

### Who is this insight valuable to?

For government institutions.
